Chapter 2: Two branches

What makes a poker evaluator complicated, is the Flush category (including the
Straight Flush). If we don't care about the Flush, we can ignore the suits, and
simplify the 52-bit binary to a 13-bit quinary (base 5 number). The reason we
need base 5, is that for each rank, there can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers of cards,
hence 5 possibilities.

So we can split the problem into two branches, the hands with a flush and the
hands without a flush. Luckily, in 7-card poker, if there are at least five
cards in the same suit, this hand is guaranteed to be either Flush or Straight
Flush. Because if we have at least 5 cards in the same suit, these 5 cards must
have different ranks, then at most 2 cards from the other suit cannot form a
Four of a Kind or a Full House.

We also know that, there cannot be two flushes in different suits in a 7-card
hand.

It's not hard to determine whether a hand has a flush or not, we only need a
counter for each suit. In the meantime, we need to maintain a binary for each
suit, so that when we see a flush, we can pass the corresponding binary to the
function that evaluates flush hands.

For example, given the input

 5 of Spades,
 4 of Spades,
 7 of Spades,
 Jack of Diamonds,
 Ace of Clubs,
 10 of Spades,
 8 of Spades,

our 4 counters and binaries are:

 Spades:        counter 5, binary 0000101101100
 Hearts:        counter 0, binary 0000000000000
 Clubs:         counter 1, binary 1000000000000
 Diamonds:		counter 1, binary 0001000000000

As soon as we see the counter of Spades is greater than 4, we can pass the
binary 0000101101100 to the next function to evaluate the flush. We don't need
to worry about the other cards in other suits, because none of those cards can
be part of the best 5-card hand.

We can of course use the HashNBinaryKSum function and three hash table (k can be
5, 6 and 7) to evaluate the flush binary. However, considering the number
$2^{13}$ = 8192 is not very large, we can directly look up a table of size 8192,
that saves us a loop of 13 cycles to compute the perfect hash.

If the hand contains no more than 7 cards, we can now immediately return the
value of the flush as a final result. Otherwise, we still need to go through the
nonflush branch, and compare both results.

The other branch will be discussed in the next chapter.
